# Medium Test: Optimal Partitioning with Poisson Loss

Implement a solver for the optimal partitioning problem with Poisson loss and no constraints, by modifying the [PeakSegOptimal](https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegOptimal) package.

## Goal

- Implement `PiecewisePoissonLossLog::set_to_unconstrained_min_of` method
- Compute N x 1 array of optimal cost functions
- Validate against `Segmentor3IsBack::Segmentor(model=1)`
- Write `testthat` unit tests

## Status

TODO
